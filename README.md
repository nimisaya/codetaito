## Learnt

I created this to learn react and <canvas>. I've enjoyed learning things like:

- Working with React Router
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useLayoutEffect, useRef) and custom hooks (useDropdown)
- Had a lot of fun experimenting with canvas and seeing the impact of a state dependency on the canvas rendering.
